# Online_class

Imagine that we want to design a system for conducting online classes. 

This project contains domain description, EER, relational model and SQL(CREATE statements, INSERT statements, some required queries, functions, procedures and triggers)

In this system, we can have three types of users: instructors, students, and system administrators.

Instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) can organize classes, assign exercises to students, conduct exams, and perform other related tasks. They can also have assistants to help them in the classes.

Students, in addition to attending classes and exams, can submit their exercises and interact with the system to address any issues they encounter.

System administrators are responsible for managing the system, handling technical problems, defining classes, and performing other administrative tasks.

Another important concept in this system is the notion of a "class" or a study group. Students can participate in multiple classes, each of which has a designated instructor and a list of participants. In addition to participants, each class can have various activities such as exams, exercises, and learning resources associated with it.

Along with these concepts, there are additional data elements such as terms and faculties that need to be considered for organizing and managing the system.
